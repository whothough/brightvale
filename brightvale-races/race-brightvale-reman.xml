            <h4>Men of the Plains.</h4>
            <p>Physical: Dark skin, black hair, strong build, distinctive black eyes, very little differentiation between pupil and iris.</p>
            <p>Culture: The Nomads of the Great North are a mixture of infamous raiders and reputable traders. Some hordes travel as great caravans, from one extreme of the continent to the other, trading exotic goods. Others, whether out of barbarric tradition or sheer desparation, loot and pillage as roaming tribes of raiders. They're known for their egalitarian society, sharing their profits or plunders, and following traderoutes or necessity rather than Khans or Captains. They wear thick leathers, lined with fur, and are rarely seen without some form of hood, hat or helmet.</p>
