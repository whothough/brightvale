            <h4>Men of the Wald.</h4>
            <p>Physical: Dark skin, dark hair, light build, distinctive multi-tone, straight hair, forming streaks or lighter and darker hair.</p>
            <p>Culture: Woldermans distance themselves from the rest of sapient society, and aggressively protect their woodland territory for themselves. To outsiders, they are famed as feral and barbarous: attacking loggers and hunters that stray too far into their forests with impunity. Within themselves, they are a spiritual and deeply communal people. They usually wear trousers and short tunics made from animal hides, and are rarely seen without a bow and a logging sword. They live in intricate networks of houses and bridges suspended in the canopies of dense forests. Hunting trails are often built across the forest, allowing them to stalk and hunt without touching the forest floor.</p>
