            <h4>Men of the Sands.</h4>
            <p>Physical: Dark skin, black hair, light build, distinctive range of colours for eyes (reds, yellows, purples common as well as blues, greens and browns).</p>
            <p>Culture: Migrations into what were once tesman imperial territory have left the tesman people as a (exceptionally privileged) diaspora in their own homeland. They occupy the highest echelons of society across the South and East, and have become, as a people, synonymous with the gold-lined silks they're seldom seen without. They usually wear their hair long and loose as a show of decadence: that they don't need to make compromises for the sake of practicality.</p>
